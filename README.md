# Python BHOP Script for CS:GO

This is a simple Python script for bunny hopping (BHOP) in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The script uses the `pymem` library to interact with the game's memory and achieve bunny hopping functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `pymem`: You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install pymem
  ```
- `pywin32`: This library is required for Windows API calls. You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install pywin32
  ```

Also, ensure that you have obtained the correct offset from the `pus dumper` repository. You can find the offsets in the [hazedumper/csgo.json](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.json) file.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the prerequisites.
4. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `bhop.py` script is located.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   py bhop.py
   ```
6. The script will start running and enable bunny hopping in CS:GO.
